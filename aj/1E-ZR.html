 I´m from Bory but today I am talking about Žïár nad Sázavou. It is not far from my village.
Žïár is in the region of the Highlands. There is a population of about 22 thousand people. Cultural life: At the beginning of February there is a regular folk costume ball. There is a Church of St. Jan Nepomuk on Zelená hora. The church of St. Jan Nepomuk on Zelená hora is registered in UNESCO. There is also a renaissance town hall. Next to the town hall there is a new fountain. There is a bus and train station. Public transport started to go here in 1957, now 14 public bus stops operatre 14 there. In our city there are four elementary schools, two grammar schools, and nine other schools. In our city we have a lot of sport successful people for example Martina Sáblíková and Petr Koukal. Martina Sáblíková is the best speed ice skater in the Czech republic. Petr Koukal is a hockey player who plays in HC Eaton Pardubice.
