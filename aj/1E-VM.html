Vojnùv Mìstec is a small town located in Vysoèina (in the Highlands). It was founded by Žïár's monastery in the late 13th century, and it got its final name from Jan Vojna of Štìtí. There are two settlements under its town hall, Borky and a partisan settlement of Nová Hu, which was one of the main centres of the partisan movement in Vysoèina. Vojnùv Mìstec has more than 700 inhabitants. Initially it does not seem like it, but we have several cultural monuments too. The first thing you'll probably see when you arrive in the square is a statue of St. Jan Nepomuk and almost next to it there is a memorial to those who died during the First and Second World Wars. The local church is called St. Andrew's Church. It currently has two bells and the third is in the cemetery chapel. There is a monument to Peter Aschenbrenner who committed suicide at Nová Hu. There are two small shops and two pubs, we have a dentist, a library, a store with clothes and there is quite a lot of companies and craftsmen. We have a primary school, but it has only four classes. Due to its location, it’s a nice place for tourists who appreciate nature.</p>
